The Argus-distribution code base works as a framework and the two core projects So-bogus and ARCSim are called as libraries.

So-bogus is freely distributed under open source licenses, described in its [license](deps/bogus-interface/extern/so-bogus/LICENSE.md) file.

ARCSim is free for educational, research, and not-for-profit use, subject to certain conditions on attribution as described in the [ARCSim license](deps/libarcsim/LICENSE).

Please see the respective license files in the subproject directories for details. The framework code in Argus-distribution itself is provided for reference as an example application, but is not covered by a license.

You are free to use, copy, and modify this software for research and other purposes, subject to the conditions of the above licenses. However, if you intend to distribute your modified code as open source, please be aware that to our knowledge the licenses for So-bogus and ARCSim are not compatible. So it is not clear that a single derivative project that includes both would be redistributable under a common license. To make distribution easier, we plan to reimplement this project under a full open-source license in the future, but we cannot say how soon this will happen.
